# NODEJS INTERVIEW PEP

#### Differentiate between JavaScript and NodeJS.
  Ans : 

 JavaScript:
- Client-Side Language: JavaScript is primarily a client-side scripting      language, meaning it runs in the browser of the user.
- Front-End Development: It is mainly used for creating interactive and dynamic elements on websites, such as animations, form validation, and interactivity.
-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript code needs to be compatible with different web browsers, which may have variations in their interpretation of JavaScript.
- Runs in Browser: JavaScript code executes within the browser environment and interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate web pages dynamically.
- Single-Threaded: Traditionally, JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time.


Node.js:

- Server-Side Runtime Environment: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side.
- Back-End Development: It is used for building server-side applications, such as web servers, APIs, and networking tools.
V8 JavaScript Engine: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by Google Chrome.
- Event-Driven and Asynchronous: Node.js is event-driven and asynchronous, which means it can handle multiple connections simultaneously without blocking execution, making it efficient for I/O-intensive operations.
- NPM (Node Package Manager): Node.js comes with npm, a package manager that allows developers to easily install, manage, and share dependencies for their projects.
- Cross-Platform: Node.js applications can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
